# Setup Instructions for Integrating Amazon SageMaker

For visualization purposes, the connected vehicle environment will function like the image below. But we'll get into more detail on that in the [demo section](https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/Digital-Twins-With-AWS/blob/main/Demo_Instructions.md).

Now that you've finished the first three parts ([part 1](https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/Digital-Twins-With-AWS/tree/main/atlas-backend), [part 2](https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/Digital-Twins-With-AWS/tree/main/device-ts), [part 3](https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/Digital-Twins-With-AWS/tree/main/mobile-swift)) , you can start setting up your AWS SageMaker integration. The AWS SageMaker integration allows you to analyze your data and then send that analyzed data back to MongoDB Atlas and consequently to the the users of the devices.

## Congrats!
You've now successfully set up everything you need to run a Digital Twin demonstration:  
  * [Part 1: The MongoDB Atlas Digital-Twin Backend](https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/Digital-Twins-With-AWS/tree/main/atlas-backend) 
  * [Part 2: The Typescript Vehicle Simulator](https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/Digital-Twins-With-AWS/tree/main/vehicle-ts) 
  * [Part 3: The iOS Swift Vehicle Controller Mobile Application](https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/Digital-Twins-With-AWS/tree/main/mobile-swift)
  * [Part 4: The Amazon SageMaker Integration](https://github.com/mongodb-partners/Vehicle-Digital-Twin-Solution)
